# Open Smart Environment - Framework
This package is a part of the OSE suite.
All packages can be found [on GitHub](https://github.com/opensmartenvironment/).

<b>Open Smart Environment software is a suite for creating
multi-instance applications that work as a single whole.</b><br>
Imagine, for example, a personal mesh running on various devices
including HTPCs, phones, tablets, workstations, servers, Raspberry
Pis, home automation gadgets, wearables, drones, etc.

OSE software consists of several npm packages: a [framework](http://opensmartenvironment.github.io/doc/#framework) running
on Node.js, an [HTML5 frontend](http://opensmartenvironment.github.io/doc/#html5frontend), extending
packages and a set of example applications.

**Set-up of current example applications.** Here,
OSE provides a [Media player](http://opensmartenvironment.github.io/doc/#example-player) running on an HTPC
that can be controlled by an IR remote through
[LIRC](http://opensmartenvironment.github.io/doc/#example-lirc) and is capable of playing streams from a
[DVB streamer](http://opensmartenvironment.github.io/doc/#example-dvb) and control devices through GPIO
pins on a [Raspberry Pi](http://opensmartenvironment.github.io/doc/#example-rpi)

For more information about OSE see **[the documentation](http://opensmartenvironment.github.io/doc/)**.

## Package description
Extensible framework for development and rapid prototyping of
applications based on Node.js and HTML5.

in. It brings the ability to easily monitor and control the
environment, and to automate tasks.
